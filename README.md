# hello-world
Hello world, this is me, there is no where else I would rather be.

Hi there
My name is Simon Youd
I am an Educator living in Devonport,Tasmania, Australia
I am learning to use GitHub and start programming/coding to control some of what I do on the internet.
I have been greatly encouraged by the path and help left by Doug Belshaw @dajbelshaw
I believe learning is at its greatest in community, feel free to come and join mine.

Cheers
Simon
